# NYC Flights Data 2013-Analysis

Analyzing NYC Flights data 2013 using various statistical and visualization tools, the project majorly hovers around the delay statistics with a nuanced intervention into nearly all the possible factors. The project uses SAS and R Programming for analysis of the data on statistical grounds, while using advanced visualization extensions available in R to produce visual evidences of the results found.

The project attempts to propose a model to predict the arrival and departure delays considering various factors ranging from the weather conditions to the manufactural details of the aircraft. We categorize the delay in certain intevals of the duration and fit a logistic regression model to classify the given set of features into one of those categories. The predictions obtained by the model are approximately 70% accurate on validation data and opens the doors for further research.
